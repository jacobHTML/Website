I got a new laptop today. Not because I wanted, but because my
Macbook Pro mid 2012 decided it was time to say goodbye. The
logic board killed itself two weeks ago. I've been very busy with
work and studies lately, so I couldn't find the time to go to the store
until today (I need to see a laptop before I buy it.)

So today I bought the beautiful Asus Zenbook 3 Deluxe, a premium laptop
in royal blue and gold. Really unique. So I got it and when I opened the box,
it appeared to be a returned model with some scratches on it.
