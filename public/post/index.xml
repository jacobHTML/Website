      <description>&lt;p&gt;I got a new laptop today. Not because I wanted, but because my
Macbook Pro mid 2012 decided it was time to say goodbye. The
logic board killed itself two weeks ago. I&amp;rsquo;ve been very busy with
work and studies lately, so I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find the time to go to the store
until today (I need to see a laptop before I buy it.)

      <description>Welcome to my blog! It&amp;rsquo;s my first web page available on the internet. I decided to create one a long time ago, and I spent many hours making a good one, but in the end I decided to keep it simple and build a static site with Hugo. (I&amp;rsquo;ll make a post explaining the process soon.)
I don&amp;rsquo;t know how much I&amp;rsquo;ll be writing or what about, but I&amp;rsquo;ll try to do an article per month at the very least.</description>
